LovelyHeads is a mod that fixes the head stack picking with a middle mouse click (you will now get an exact copy of the head, not the standard one), makes heads more useful by adding a few blocks for late game stages that interact with them and adds a little more opportunity to decorate your home with trophies from slain enemies.

List of the additions:

1. Stack picking

When you middle-click in creative on a head placed in the world, you will get an exact replica of the head.

2. Command for Obtaining Heads by Username

Use /getHead <name> to get a player head with the matching nbt. Just a small command, instead of having to write novels to get one single head

3. Polymorph head

A block found in ancient city chests that takes on the shape of the player who placed it.

4. Head Constructor

The new block allows you to create player and mob heads, as well as turn player heads into schemes for further multiple reproduction of them

5. Beheading Enchantment
   
Striking a weapon with this enchantment has a small chance of casting a Beheading Mark. Death of a creature with this effect will cause its head to fall off. By modifying the game rules, you can determine whether only player heads will fall out or also the heads of mobs (default is true), and whether the effect will apply to Wither Skeletons (default is false).

6. Player Teleport, Item Transmitter and Head Pedestals

Two new blocks that interact with the heads on the head pedestals: Player Teleport teleports the player to the head's owner, and Item Transmitter transfers items to his inventory. Both have their own cooldowns, which can be accelerated by echo shards

7. Trophy Plaque

Decorative plaque for placing heads with the owner's name if it is a player's head.

The mod will continue to evolve and in the future I hope to add more features, and, of course, fix bugs and other annoyances that are already surely there but were not noticed by me
